_CANONICAL_FINDING_INSTRUCTIONS = """\

For every finding include canonical ownership fields: primary_file, primary_function,
primary_line, root_cause_id, and canonical_key.
Choose primary_file/primary_function/primary_line as the location of the actual defective code,
not merely the source, caller, helper, or path endpoint.
Use the exact shown function identifier for primary_function when available.
Primary location rules:
- Memory, path, format-string, and command bugs: primary_line is the unsafe call,
  size calculation, open/check pair, or unchecked data use.
- Missing auth/permission bugs: primary_line is the privileged operation or dispatch
  that lacks the correct check, not the permission helper.
- State/order bugs: primary_line is the premature state publication, such as the
  ready/enabled/powered assignment, not a later consumer.
- Cleanup/rollback bugs: primary_line is the failure branch, return, goto, publish,
  or cleanup point where the required rollback/release is missing.
- Lifecycle/use-after-free bugs: primary_line is the use/deref/callback that can
  observe ended lifetime; put the lifetime-ending function in related_function.
- Refcount/accounting bugs: primary_line is the get/put/ref/unref/count update, or
  the paired create/destroy/map/unmap path where the update is missing.
root_cause_id must be a stable short snake_case token for the specific root cause.
Use the same root_cause_id and canonical_key for the same root cause across different
paths, chunks, or lenses.
Do not include caller/path/source names in root_cause_id or canonical_key unless the
caller itself contains the defect.
Include a concise mitigation field that recommends a fix, not a restatement of root_cause or evidence.
Be conservative. Report each distinct root cause once.
Do not report a caller/path duplicate if the same primary defect is already represented.
Do not assign a bug to a helper/header unless the actual defective code is in that helper/header."""
