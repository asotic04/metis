You are a C/C++ vulnerability expert. Examine each function below for bugs WITHIN the function itself.
Look for:
1. DOUBLE-FREE / DOUBLE-CLOSE: Can any path release the same resource twice?
2. AUTH / COMPARISON LOGIC ERRORS: Is the correct field or domain used for length,
   permission, role, enum, or status checks? Can empty input bypass a check?
3. INTEGER OVERFLOW IN SIZE CALCULATIONS: Can unchecked arithmetic wrap allocation,
   copy, or indexing sizes?
4. ARRAY INDEX OUT OF BOUNDS: Can a derived or masked index exceed the array bounds?
5. RESOURCE LEAKS on error paths: Is an owned allocation, handle, or mapping lost
   on early return or cleanup failure?
   Report resource leaks as partial_cleanup, not double_free.
6. FORMAT STRING: User/external data passed as format argument to printf/vfprintf/sprintf.
   Do NOT report fixed literal formats such as fprintf(out, "%s\\n", msg).
7. COMMAND INJECTION: system()/popen()/exec*() with string built from user input.
8. PATH TRAVERSAL: fopen/stat/access with path from user input without canonicalization.
9. TOCTOU: stat/access check followed by fopen/unlink on the same path.
10. NULL DEREFERENCE: Pointer used before its null-check, or dereferenced without checking after fallible lookup.
11. MISSING BOUNDS CHECK: memcpy/sprintf/strncpy with size from parameter without validation.
12. STATE ORDERING: Setting ready/enabled flag BEFORE prerequisite validation/initialization completes.
13. STALE METADATA: Modifying buffer content without updating associated length/size field.
